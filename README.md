# packetevents by retrooper

A lightweight spigot packetlistener & packetsender coded by retrooper.

## Credit:

PacketEvents uses a modified version of [TinyProtocol](http://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib/blob/master/TinyProtocol/src/main/java/com/comphenix/tinyprotocol/TinyProtocol.java) by DeprecatedLuke to support 1.7.10 & 1.8.
I modified DeprecatedLuek's version of TinyProtocol and added support for 1.9+ versions.

PacketEvents also took Atlas' Packet class.(all the packet names)
