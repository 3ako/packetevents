# packetevents by retrooper

A lightweight spigot packetlistener & packetsender coded by retrooper.

Credit to TinyProtocol, PacketEvents uses a modified version of [TinyProtocol](http://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib/blob/master/TinyProtocol/src/main/java/com/comphenix/tinyprotocol/TinyProtocol.java) by DeprecatedLuke to support 1.7.10 & 1.8.
I modified TinyProtocol to support 1.9+.
I also make the wrapper classes and useful utilities that support 1.7.10 -> 1.15.2!
This packetlistener is **only** supported on spigot servers and works on these spigot forks:(PaperSpigot, Tuinity)
