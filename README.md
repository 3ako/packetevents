# packetevents by retrooper

An asynchronous spigot packetListener coded by retrooper.

Credit to TinyProtocol, PacketEvents uses a modified version of [TinyProtocol](http://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib/blob/master/TinyProtocol/src/main/java/com/comphenix/tinyprotocol/TinyProtocol.java) by DeprecatedLuke to support 1.7.10 & 1.8.
PacketEvents does some extra modifications to support the rest of the versions!
All I do is make the wrapper classes and useful utilities that support 1.7.10 -> 1.15.2!
This packetlistener is supported on spigot servers(Spigot, PaperSpigot, ...)
